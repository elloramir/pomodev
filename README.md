### Pomodev
I made this project due my personal frustration about the time limit proporsed by pomodoro clocks, as a programmer
is pretty hard contain my-self on a idea. Sometimes, I get a bit bored with stuff, but there are moments when I just want to keep on coding because these awesome ideas pop into my head real quick..
